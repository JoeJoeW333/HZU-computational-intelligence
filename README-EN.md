## Overview of Algorithm Implementation
### Immune Algorithm
The implementation of the immune algorithm for logistics path optimization has the following characteristics:
- **Dynamic selection strategy**: Fitness calculation integrates affinity and concentration information, and weights are dynamically adjusted.
- **Affinity Calculation System**: Using Improved Hamming Distance to Calculate Antibody Similarity.
- **Concentration control mechanism**: Maintain population diversity and avoid premature convergence.
- **Innovation and Optimization**:
  - **Hybrid similarity caching**: Reducing computational complexity from O(NÂ²) to O(N).
  - **Dynamic weight adjustment**: Balancing exploration and development capabilities.
  - **Multi-operator mutation strategy**: Fusion exchange, reverse order, and insertion of three mutation methods.
  The experimental results show that compared with the standard genetic algorithm and improved PSO, the immune algorithm has significant advantages in shortest distance, convergence speed, and solution stability.
